  * Course overview: Reading, presenting and discussing state-of-the-art research papers on the topic of security and privacy of machine learning systems. 
  * Responsibilities: selection of relevant papers, evaluation of programming assignments, student presentations and student diaries.

### Tutoring
* Tutors in various seminar courses supervise the student(s) who pick topic(s) offered by tutors. Tutors meet with the student(s) a few times during the semester, guide them in writing the seminar paper, and provide feedback on intermediate drafts of the paper. I was the tutor for the following courses:
